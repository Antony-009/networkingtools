Project Overview (Simple English)

This project is called "puthon_syberproject". It helps to watch network traffic and detect if something suspicious is happening, like hacking or attacks.

Here is what each file does:

1---main.py

This is the main file that starts the program.

It connects all the parts together and runs the Intrusion Detection System (IDS).

2---ids_gui.py

This file makes the simple window (GUI) that you can see on the screen.

You can use buttons to start or stop the system and see results.

3---packet_sniffer.py

This file listens to the network.

It catches the packets (small data pieces) that move in the network.

4---detection_engine.py

This is the brain of the system.

It checks the packets and decides if something looks like an attack.

5---requirements.txt

This file lists all the Python packages (tools) that are needed to run the project.

You can install them using this file with pip.

This project helps in cybersecurity by checking network activity and telling you if something looks wrong or dangerous.

Tools and Technologies Used (Simple English)

Python

Main programming language used to write this project.

scapy

A Python library used to read and analyze network packets.

tkinter

A Python library used to create the GUI (the window you click on).

threading

Helps run many parts of the program at the same time.

socket

Helps connect to the network and get data.

re (Regular Expressions)

Used to search for patterns in text to detect attacks.

These tools work together to watch the network, detect any suspicious behavior, and show results in a simple user interface.
